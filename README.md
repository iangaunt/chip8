# iangaunt/chip8

A basic emulator for running chip8 roms. Has working user input, colors, and graphics using SDL. Built in a couple of days from scratch.

If you want to change the ROM, unfortunately, you have to locate the file on your Desktop path and add it into the `main.cpp` file. There are a few roms in the `roms` folder in `src`.
